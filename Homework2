Supplementary Problems on Algebra and Arithmetic:
A. (12 points)Let p(x) = x3+ 2x2 + x+ 2 and q(x) = x4 + 2x3 + 2x2+ 2x + 1 be polynomials overGF3. Compute gcd(p(x), q(x)) with leading coefficient 1. Then find polynomials f(x) and g(x) over GF3 such that gcd(p(x), q(x)) = f(x) p(x) + g(x) q(x).
B. (10 points) Show that for n≥ 3,x^(2^n )+x+1 is reducible overGF2.
C.(14 points) Let n = 2015 + 2(The last 2 digits of your student ID number). Find the positive integer a<2^64 such that a^13337≡n mod2^64.
